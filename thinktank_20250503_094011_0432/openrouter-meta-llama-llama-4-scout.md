### Implementation Tasks to Fix System Theme Detection Issue

Based on the consultant plan and provided context, here are the specific implementation tasks to fix the system theme detection issue in the Scry splash page:

#### Core Fixes for Layout Component

1. **Remove Hardcoded `className="dark"`**: 
    - **Task**: Update `app/layout.tsx` to remove the hardcoded `className="dark"` attribute from the root element.
    - **Rationale**: This change allows the dynamic theme class application from the ThemeProvider to take effect.

2. **Integrate Dynamic Theme Class**:
    - **Task**: Ensure that the ThemeProvider is properly wrapping the application and applying the dynamic theme class based on the current theme (light or dark).
    - **Rationale**: This ensures that the theme is applied dynamically and consistently across the application.

#### Necessary Adjustments to ThemeProvider

3. **Verify ThemeProvider Configuration**:
    - **Task**: Confirm that the ThemeProvider is correctly configured in `app/layout.tsx` or a higher-level component (e.g, `_app.tsx` in Next.js).
    - **Rationale**: Ensures that the theme context is properly managed and passed down to all components.

4. **Ensure Theme State Management**:
    - **Task**: Verify that the theme state management (e.g., using a context or a state management library like Zustand) is correctly implemented and accessible throughout the application.
    - **Rationale**: This ensures that the theme can be dynamically switched and applied.

#### Component Styling Verification Steps

5. **Review Component Styling for Light/Dark Modes**:
    - **Task**: Manually review and test components, especially those directly affected by theme changes (e.g., background color, text color, logo visibility), to ensure they render correctly in both light and dark modes.
    - **Rationale**: Identifies any components that may not be correctly styled for the dynamic theme.

6. **Automate Theme-Related Testing**:
    - **Task**: Write and integrate automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) to verify that theme switching works correctly and components render as expected under different themes.
    - **Rationale**: Ensures consistent theme behavior across different scenarios and code changes.

#### Testing Procedures for Theme Switching

7. **Implement Theme Switching Tests**:
    - **Task**: Develop tests to cover theme switching scenarios, ensuring that:
        - The background changes correctly.
        - Content (logo, headline text) appears or disappears as expected.
        - The CTA button and other interactive elements behave correctly.
    - **Rationale**: Validates the functionality of theme switching.

#### Recommended Cleanup for Maintainability

8. **Code Review and Refactoring**:
    - **Task**: Perform a code review to identify any redundant or theme-related code that can be refactored or removed.
    - **Rationale**: Improves code maintainability and reduces technical debt.

9. **Documentation Update**:
    - **Task**: Update relevant documentation to reflect changes made to fix the theme detection issue and any new testing procedures.
    - **Rationale**: Ensures that future developers have accurate information on theme handling and testing.

By following these tasks, the issue with system theme detection in the Scry splash page should be resolved, ensuring a better user experience and maintainable codebase.
