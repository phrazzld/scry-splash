# T031 Summary - Add Coverage Check to Pre-push Hook

## Changes Made

I updated the `.githooks/pre-push` script to:

1. Run tests with coverage before allowing pushes to the repository:
   ```sh
   echo "üìã Running tests with coverage check..."
   pnpm test:coverage
   ```

2. Check the exit code and prevent pushing if coverage thresholds aren't met:
   ```sh
   if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
     echo "‚ùå Test coverage check failed. Coverage is below thresholds."
     echo "   Run 'pnpm test:coverage' to see detailed coverage information."
     echo "   Fix coverage issues before pushing or update thresholds in jest.config.js."
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

3. Parse the coverage summary and display current coverage metrics:
   ```sh
   if [ -f "coverage/coverage-summary.json" ]; then
     # Extract coverage percentages using grep
     statements=$(grep -o '"statements":{"total":[0-9]*,"covered":[0-9]*,"skipped":[0-9]*,"pct":[0-9.]*' coverage/coverage-summary.json | grep -o '"pct":[0-9.]*' | grep -o '[0-9.]*')
     branches=$(grep -o '"branches":{"total":[0-9]*,"covered":[0-9]*,"skipped":[0-9]*,"pct":[0-9.]*' coverage/coverage-summary.json | grep -o '"pct":[0-9.]*' | grep -o '[0-9.]*')
     functions=$(grep -o '"functions":{"total":[0-9]*,"covered":[0-9]*,"skipped":[0-9]*,"pct":[0-9.]*' coverage/coverage-summary.json | grep -o '"pct":[0-9.]*' | grep -o '[0-9.]*')
     lines=$(grep -o '"lines":{"total":[0-9]*,"covered":[0-9]*,"skipped":[0-9]*,"pct":[0-9.]*' coverage/coverage-summary.json | grep -o '"pct":[0-9.]*' | grep -o '[0-9.]*')
     
     echo "üìä Current coverage metrics:"
     echo "   - Statements: $statements%"
     echo "   - Branches: $branches%"
     echo "   - Functions: $functions%"
     echo "   - Lines: $lines%"
   fi
   ```

4. Update the success message to include the new check:
   ```sh
   echo "‚úÖ Linting, type checking, and test coverage passed! Pushing changes..."
   ```

## Implementation Details

- The script now runs the same coverage checks locally that are performed in CI
- Coverage thresholds are determined by the settings in `jest.config.js`
- When coverage is below thresholds, the push is blocked with helpful error messages
- Current coverage metrics are displayed to provide context
- The hook ensures parity between local development and CI environments

## Verification

This implementation ensures that:
1. The pre-push hook runs jest tests with coverage
2. If coverage doesn't meet the thresholds set in jest.config.js, the push is blocked
3. Clear error messages show why the push was blocked
4. Current coverage metrics are displayed for context

The implementation adheres to quality standards by ensuring that the same coverage checks performed in CI are also applied locally before code is pushed to the repository, preventing builds from failing due to coverage issues.
