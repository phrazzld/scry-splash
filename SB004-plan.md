# SB004 · Component · P1: Create Logo component (COMPLETED ✅)

## Task Analysis

Task ID: SB004  
Title: Create Logo component

### Requirements
1. Extract the "Scry." logo into a standalone component
2. Support size variants
3. Include proper semantics and a11y attributes

### Done Criteria
1. Logo component renders correctly
2. Component includes proper aria-label

## Implementation Plan

This is a simple atomic component task that requires extracting the existing Scry logo implementation from the app/page.tsx file into a reusable component with size variants and proper accessibility attributes.

### Current Implementation

Currently, the Scry logo is implemented directly in the page.tsx file as follows:

```tsx
<h1 className="text-display font-bold text-chalk" aria-label="Scry">
  Scry<span className="opacity-70">.</span>
</h1>
```

Key observations:
- The logo is text-based (not an SVG or image)
- It displays "Scry." with the period having reduced opacity (70%)
- It uses the "text-display" class (5.33rem/64pt font size)
- It uses the "font-bold" weight
- It has an aria-label of "Scry" (excluding the period)
- It's semantically an h1 element

### Logo Component Design

I'll create a more flexible Logo component with the following features:

1. **Size Variants**: Small, medium, large, and default (matches current implementation)
2. **Color Customization**: Allow overriding the default chalk color
3. **Semantic Markup Options**: Allow using different HTML elements (h1, div, span) based on context
4. **Proper a11y**: Maintain accessibility with appropriate aria-labels

### Implementation Approach

1. Create a new file: `components/ui/logo.tsx`
2. Implement the Logo component using:
   - cva (class-variance-authority) for variants
   - Optional props for customization
   - Default values matching current implementation
   - Proper accessibility attributes
3. Create a Storybook story file showing all variants
4. Include a11y checks in the Storybook story

## Implementation Steps (All Completed ✅)

1. ✅ Created the Logo component with size variants
2. ✅ Added customization options for color and semantic element
3. ✅ Implemented proper accessibility attributes
4. ✅ Created comprehensive Storybook stories with a11y checks
5. ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors and passed type checking
6. ✅ Updated TODO.md to mark task as complete
7. ✅ Committed changes

Implementation complete and ready for the next task (SB005: Implement Button using shadcn/ui Button).
