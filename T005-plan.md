# T005 · Feature · P1: Integrate ThemeToggleButton into footer or designated location

## Task Description
According to the TODO.md and PLAN.md, this task involves integrating the previously implemented ThemeToggleButton component into the footer or another designated location in the application. The goal is to ensure the button is properly positioned, styled, and functionally integrated with the rest of the UI.

## Analysis
This is a "Simple" task as it primarily involves adding the existing ThemeToggleButton component to the Footer component. The main considerations are proper positioning, styling, and ensuring it works correctly in the actual application context.

## Implementation Approach
1. Update the Footer component to include the ThemeToggleButton
2. Position the button in a way that is visually balanced and easy to access
3. Add appropriate styling to ensure it fits with the footer's design
4. Ensure the button maintains its accessibility features
5. Test the integration to verify both visual appearance and functionality

## Implementation Details
1. Import the ThemeToggleButton component into the Footer
2. Add the button to the footer, likely in the same grid item as the attribution text
3. Use flex layout to position the button appropriately:
   - If centered footer: Position it below or above the attribution text
   - If not centered: Position it at the right side of the footer
4. Add appropriate spacing and alignment
5. Ensure the button maintains its existing styling and functionality

## Expected Outcome
- The ThemeToggleButton will be visible in the footer
- The button will be properly positioned and styled
- The button will function correctly, toggling between light and dark themes
- The integration will be responsive across different viewport sizes

## Testing Plan
1. Visual inspection in browser at different viewport sizes
2. Manual testing of the toggle functionality
3. Verify accessibility is maintained
