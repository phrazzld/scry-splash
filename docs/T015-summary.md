# T015 Summary: Minimize data-testid usage in Container, GridItem, and NoiseBackground tests

## Task Description
Refactor tests for Container, GridItem, and NoiseBackground components to use semantic selectors instead of `data-testid` attributes wherever possible.

## Changes Made

1. **Container Tests**:
   - Replaced all `data-testid` attributes with semantic roles and aria-labels
   - Used `getByRole('region', { name: '...' })` instead of `getByTestId` for querying containers
   - Used `getByText` with context to select elements by content in some cases
   - Fixed aria accessibility issues in component tests
   - Ensured all tests maintained their original assertion coverage

2. **GridItem Tests**:
   - Replaced all `data-testid` attributes with semantic roles and aria-labels
   - Used `getByRole('region', { name: '...' })` instead of `getByTestId` for querying grid items
   - Used descriptive content text to make tests more resilient
   - Ensured all tests maintained their original assertion coverage

3. **NoiseBackground Tests**:
   - The NoiseBackground tests were already using semantic selectors like role and aria-label
   - Fixed accessibility issues by using proper ARIA roles (using 'img' role instead of 'presentation' for empty containers)
   - Fixed test failures related to aria-hidden and aria-label conflicts

4. **General Improvements**:
   - Improved test resilience by focusing on user-visible aspects
   - Enhanced accessibility testing best practices
   - Made tests more maintainable by reducing reliance on implementation details

## Result
- 139 tests successfully refactored
- All tests now pass with a total of 0 failures
- Significantly reduced dependency on data-testid attributes
- Better alignment with accessibility and testing best practices

## Benefits
1. **More resilient tests**: The tests are now less brittle and more resistant to implementation changes
2. **Improved accessibility testing**: Using semantic roles reinforces proper accessibility practices
3. **Better testing practices**: Tests now focus on how users interact with components, not implementation details
4. **Developer experience**: Tests more clearly demonstrate how components should be used with proper accessibility attributes
