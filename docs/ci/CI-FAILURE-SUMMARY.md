# CI Failure Summary

## Build Information

- **PR**: #10 - E2E Testing Infrastructure and CI Integration
- **Branch**: test/test-002-e2e-setup
- **Workflow Run**: 15142060921
- **Failed Job**: e2e
- **Platform**: ubuntu-latest
- **Timestamp**: 2025-05-20T15:50:46Z

## Failure Summary

All E2E tests in the test suite failed across all three browser engines (Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit) with the same error pattern. The primary issue appears to be with the `navigateTo` method in the `BasePage` class defined in `e2e/utils/enhanced-testing.ts`.

## Root Cause

The failure occurs at line 508 in `enhanced-testing.ts`:

```typescript
const fullUrl = new URL(path, this.page.url()).toString();
```

The error being thrown is:

```
TypeError: Invalid URL
```

This suggests that one of the following issues is occurring:

1. The `path` parameter is malformed or contains invalid URL characters
2. The `this.page.url()` is returning an empty string or invalid URL at the point of calling
3. The combination of the two parameters is creating an invalid URL

The error is consistent across all browsers and test cases, indicating that it's a fundamental issue with the navigation logic rather than browser-specific behavior.

## Affected Tests

All tests are failing since they all depend on the `navigateTo` method:

1. CTA Flow tests:

   - Happy path test
   - Invalid email validation test
   - Server error test

2. Splash Page Load tests:
   - Navigation and main elements test
   - Visual screenshot test

## Affected Files

- `e2e/utils/enhanced-testing.ts` - Contains the root cause in the `BasePage` class's `navigateTo` method (line 508)
- `e2e/page-objects/SplashPage.pom.ts` - Uses the BasePage class and is failing when calling `navigate` method
- `e2e/tests/cta-flow.spec.ts` - All tests failing during navigation
- `e2e/tests/splash-page-load.spec.ts` - All tests failing during navigation

## Stack Trace

```
TypeError: Invalid URL
   at ../utils/enhanced-testing.ts:508
      506 |    */
      507 |   async navigateTo(path: string, options?: { retries?: number; timeout?: number }): Promise<void> {

```

## Contextual Observations

- Tests start properly and the Next.js server appears to start correctly
- The tests seem to fail immediately when attempting to navigate to any page
- The issue is consistent across multiple test runs (including retries)
- The error occurs in CI but may work differently in the local environment
- The web server logs show successful startup with the URL http://localhost:3000
