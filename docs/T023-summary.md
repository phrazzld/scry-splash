# T023 Summary: Ensure TSDoc coverage for GridItem props

## Task Description
Add comprehensive TSDoc documentation for the GridItem component and all its props in `container.tsx`.

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Component-Level Documentation**:
   - Added detailed description of the GridItem component purpose and functionality
   - Included a practical usage example showing responsive layout patterns
   - Emphasized the relationship with the Container's grid system

2. **Added Detailed Prop Documentation**:
   - **Column Span Props**: Documented span, sm, md, lg, xl props with breakpoint information
   - **Column Start Props**: Documented start, smStart, mdStart, lgStart, xlStart props with positioning details
   - **Element Type**: Documented as prop with explanation and default value
   - Added clear descriptions for each prop's purpose and usage
   - Included default values where applicable
   - Added breakpoint size information (e.g., md: 768px+)

3. **Validation**:
   - Ran typecheck (pnpm typecheck) - No errors
   - Ran linter (pnpm lint) - No errors or warnings

## Result
The GridItem component now has comprehensive TSDoc documentation that:
- Clarifies the purpose and usage of the component
- Explains how each prop affects the component's behavior
- Provides specific breakpoint information for responsive props
- Shows a practical usage example
- Maintains consistent documentation style with the Container component

This documentation will improve developer experience through better IDE tooltips and 
make the codebase more maintainable for future contributors.
