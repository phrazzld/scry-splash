# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current State Analysis

As of the latest coverage report, the project has achieved an overall coverage of **90.25%**, which meets the target threshold of 90%. However, there are opportunities for improvement and long-term maintenance of high coverage standards.

### Coverage Breakdown by Category

#### Excellent Coverage (90%+)

- **components/organisms**: 100% coverage
- **components/ui**: 96.07% coverage
- **components/ui/tokens**: 97.05% coverage
- **lib**: 100% coverage

#### Good Coverage (80-89%)

- **components/design-system**: 89.53% coverage
- **components/molecules**: 89.38% coverage

#### Needs Attention (<80%)

- **app**: 0% coverage (minimal application logic)

### Component-Specific Analysis

#### Components with Perfect Coverage (100%)

- `color-tokens.tsx`, `layout-tokens.tsx`, `shadcn-integration.tsx`, `spacing-tokens.tsx`
- `typography-tokens.tsx`, `benefit-trio.tsx`, `footer.tsx`, `pitch-section.tsx`
- `page-layout.tsx`, `splash-page.tsx`, `logo.tsx`, `noise-background.tsx`
- `input.tsx`, `constants.ts`, `utils.ts`

#### Components Needing Improvement

1. **animation-tokens.tsx** (61.11%): Missing coverage for interactive event handlers
2. **cta-section.tsx** (72.72%): Needs tests for error handling and edge cases
3. **tokens-overview.tsx** (87.5%): Missing coverage for type guards
4. **theme-script.tsx** (80%): Client-side script with limited testability

## Priority List for Testing Improvements

### High Priority

1. **app/\*** components (0% coverage)

   - `layout.tsx`, `metadata.ts`, `page.tsx`
   - While these have minimal logic, basic smoke tests would improve overall coverage

2. **animation-tokens.tsx** (61.11% → 90%+)

   - Add tests for button click handlers
   - Test animation replay functionality
   - Mock DOM manipulation for better coverage

3. **cta-section.tsx** (72.72% → 90%+)
   - Add tests for error states
   - Test form submission failures
   - Cover loading states and transitions

### Medium Priority

1. **theme-script.tsx** (80% → 90%+)

   - Add tests for different browser environments
   - Test localStorage edge cases
   - Mock window.matchMedia for preferences

2. **tokens-overview.tsx** (87.5% → 95%+)
   - Add tests for all type guard branches
   - Test different example types rendering

### Low Priority

1. Minor coverage improvements for components already above 90%
2. Edge case testing for components with near-perfect coverage

## Incremental Plan with Milestones

### Phase 1: Critical Gaps (Week 1-2)

**Target**: Bring overall coverage to 92%

- Complete testing for app components
- Improve animation-tokens.tsx to 80%+
- Improve cta-section.tsx to 85%+

### Phase 2: Component Completion (Week 3-4)

**Target**: Achieve 90%+ coverage for all major components

- Complete animation-tokens.tsx testing
- Complete cta-section.tsx testing
- Improve theme-script.tsx coverage

### Phase 3: Excellence (Week 5-6)

**Target**: Reach 93%+ overall coverage

- Complete all medium priority items
- Add integration tests for complex workflows
- Document testing best practices

### Phase 4: Maintenance (Ongoing)

**Target**: Maintain 90%+ coverage

- Establish pre-commit hooks for coverage
- Implement CI/CD coverage gates
- Regular coverage reviews

## Testing Strategies by Component Type

### Application Components (app/\*)

- Focus on smoke tests and basic rendering
- Test metadata generation
- Verify layout composition

### Interactive Components

- Use React Testing Library's user event utilities
- Mock DOM APIs where necessary
- Test all user interaction paths

### Theme/Style Components

- Mock browser APIs (localStorage, matchMedia)
- Test theme switching logic
- Verify CSS variable updates

### Documentation Components

- Test content rendering
- Verify responsive layouts
- Check accessibility compliance

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

   - Write tests before implementing new features
   - Maintain coverage thresholds in CI/CD

2. **Use Coverage Reports as Code Review Tool**

   - Require coverage reports in PRs
   - Block merges that decrease coverage

3. **Regular Coverage Audits**

   - Monthly review of coverage trends
   - Identify and address coverage regressions

4. **Team Education**
   - Share testing best practices
   - Conduct testing workshops
   - Document common testing patterns

## Coverage Configuration Updates

```javascript
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ... existing config
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 90,
      functions: 90,
      lines: 90,
      statements: 90,
    },
    "./src/components/": {
      branches: 85,
      functions: 85,
      lines: 85,
      statements: 85,
    },
  },
};
```

## Success Metrics

1. **Short-term (1 month)**

   - Overall coverage ≥ 92%
   - No component below 80% coverage
   - Coverage gates implemented in CI/CD

2. **Medium-term (3 months)**

   - Overall coverage ≥ 93%
   - All critical paths tested
   - Testing documentation complete

3. **Long-term (6 months)**
   - Sustained 90%+ coverage
   - Mature testing culture
   - Automated coverage monitoring

## Resources and Tools

- Jest & React Testing Library documentation
- Coverage visualization tools (Istanbul reports)
- Pre-commit hooks for coverage enforcement
- CI/CD integration guides

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Create tickets for each priority item
3. Assign ownership for implementation
4. Set up coverage monitoring dashboard
5. Schedule regular coverage reviews
