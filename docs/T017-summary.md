# T017 Summary: Confirm CI enforces test coverage thresholds

## Task Description
Verify that the continuous integration (CI) pipeline enforces test coverage thresholds, specifically ensuring that builds fail if coverage falls below 90%.

## Analysis Findings

1. **Initial State:**
   - There were no test coverage thresholds configured in Jest
   - No CI workflow existed for running tests with coverage reporting
   - No mechanism was in place to fail the build if coverage thresholds were not met

2. **Actions Taken:**
   - **Updated Jest Configuration:**
     - Added coverage threshold configuration requiring 90% coverage for statements, branches, functions, and lines
     - Added collectCoverageFrom configuration to focus on application code
     - Excluded stories and other non-application code from coverage calculations
     
   - **Created GitHub Actions Workflow:**
     - Added a new workflow file (.github/workflows/test-coverage.yml)
     - Set up workflow to run on pushes and PRs affecting code files
     - Configured the workflow to run tests with coverage
     - Added artifact upload for the coverage report
     - Configured a summary report for easy visibility 

3. **Validation:**
   - Ran coverage locally using `pnpm test:coverage`
   - Verified that the command fails due to insufficient coverage (below the 90% threshold)
   - This confirms the threshold enforcement is working as expected

## Current Status
- Coverage thresholds are now properly configured:
  - 90% for statements
  - 90% for branches
  - 90% for functions
  - 90% for lines
- The CI pipeline will fail if coverage falls below these thresholds
- Current overall coverage is below the threshold (48.25%), so the build will fail until coverage is improved
- The workflow uploads coverage reports as artifacts for easy access in CI

## Next Steps
While not part of this task, to get the CI passing, the team would need to:
1. Increase test coverage for components in the codebase
2. Focus on improving coverage especially in the design-system components (currently at 0%)
3. Add tests for app components and token components

## Benefits
- Enforcing coverage thresholds ensures code quality and test reliability
- CI integration prevents merging of code with insufficient test coverage
- Coverage reports provide visibility into testing gaps
- Setting a high threshold (90%) maintains a high quality bar for the codebase
