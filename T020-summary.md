# T020 · Refactor · P2: Change let to const in test files where reassignment does not occur

## Summary

I examined all test files for `let` declarations and analyzed whether each variable is reassigned or not. Here's what I found:

### 1. __tests__/components/ui/container.test.tsx
- Line 194: `let container = getByTestId('container');`
  - Reassigned on line 208
  - Should remain `let` as it's intentionally reassigned

### 2. __tests__/components/ui/logo.test.tsx
- Line 28: `let logo = screen.getByLabelText('Div Logo');`
  - Reassigned on lines 34, 39, and 44
  - Should remain `let` as it's intentionally reassigned
- Line 106: `let logo = screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1, name: 'Scry' });`
  - Reassigned on lines 119, 125, and 131
  - Should remain `let` as it's intentionally reassigned

### 3. __tests__/components/ui/noise-background.test.tsx
- Line 98: `let noiseBg = screen.getByRole('presentation', { name: 'Default color bg' });`
  - Reassigned on lines 106, 115
  - Should remain `let` as it's intentionally reassigned
- Lines 123-124: `let noiseBg` and `let noiseLayer`
  - Reassigned on lines 133-134
  - Should remain `let` as they're intentionally reassigned

### 4. __tests__/components/ui/theme-provider.test.tsx
- No `let` declarations found; all variables are declared with `const`

### 5. __tests__/components/ui/grid-item.test.tsx
- Line 73: `let gridItem = screen.getByRole('region', { name: 'Section content' });`
  - Reassigned on lines 83, 93
  - Should remain `let` as it's intentionally reassigned
- Line 118: `let gridItem = screen.getByTestId('grid-item');`
  - Reassigned on lines 125, 135
  - Should remain `let` as it's intentionally reassigned
- Line 246: `let gridItem = screen.getByTestId('grid-item');`
  - Reassigned on line 256
  - Should remain `let` as it's intentionally reassigned
- Line 423: `let results = await axe(sectionContainer);`
  - Reassigned on line 433
  - Should remain `let` as it's intentionally reassigned
- Line 463: `let results = await axe(spanContainer);`
  - Reassigned on line 483
  - Should remain `let` as it's intentionally reassigned
- Line 497: `let results = await axe(smContainer);`
  - Reassigned on lines 506, 515, and 524
  - Should remain `let` as it's intentionally reassigned
- Line 535: `let results = await axe(smStartContainer);`
  - Reassigned on lines 544, 553, and 562
  - Should remain `let` as it's intentionally reassigned

### 6. __tests__/components/molecules/hero-section.test.tsx
- Line 46: `let effectCount = 0;`
  - Reassigned using increment operator on line 58
  - Should remain `let` as it's intentionally modified

## Conclusion

After examining all `let` declarations in the test files, I found that all of them are properly used because they're intentionally reassigned later in the code. There are no `let` declarations that should be changed to `const`.

The codebase already follows best practices regarding variable declarations - using `const` for variables that don't need to be reassigned and using `let` only when the variable will be reassigned later.
