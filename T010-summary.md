# T010: Decouple Container and GridItem tests from CSS class implementation details - Summary

## Implementation Summary

The task to decouple Container and GridItem tests from CSS class implementation details has been successfully completed. The primary goal was to make the tests more resilient to implementation changes by focusing on component behavior rather than specific CSS classes.

## Changes Made

### Container Tests

1. **Props and Variants Testing**:
   - Refactored maxWidth variant tests to check that:
     - The component renders successfully with each variant
     - The maxWidth prop is processed and not passed to DOM
     - Different maxWidth values produce different styling
   - Used the same approach for padding, center, gap, gapX, and gapY variants
   - Verified that different variants produce different classNames without testing specific class strings

2. **Edge Cases Testing**:
   - Replaced specific class assertions with behavior tests
   - Verified that the component renders correctly in various edge cases
   - Only retained `grid-container` class check as it's part of the documented public API

### GridItem Tests

1. **Span Props Testing**:
   - Refactored to check component behavior rather than specific class names
   - Verified that props are processed correctly and not passed to DOM
   - Used comparisons between different variant renders to verify that styling changes appropriately

2. **Responsive Props Testing**:
   - Focused on testing that responsive props (sm, md, lg, xl, smStart, etc.) are processed correctly
   - Verified that different combinations of props result in different styling

3. **Combined Props Testing**:
   - Tested that all prop combinations are processed correctly
   - Verified that props are not passed to DOM elements
   - Compared rendered output with different prop combinations to ensure they result in different styling

## Benefits of the Approach

1. **Resilience to Implementation Changes**: The tests are now less brittle and will continue to pass even if the underlying CSS class names change, as long as the component behavior remains the same.

2. **Focus on Behavior**: Tests now focus on verifying that the components process props correctly and render with appropriate variations, rather than testing implementation details.

3. **Documentation**: Comments explain JSDOM limitations and the rationale for testing approaches, making the test intentions clear.

4. **Maintainability**: Future changes to the component's styling implementation won't require test updates as long as the behavior is preserved.

## Verification

All tests remain green after refactoring, confirming that the components' behavior is properly validated while being decoupled from specific implementation details.
