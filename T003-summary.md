# T003: ESLint Rule for Preventing Internal Mocking - Summary

## Task Completion

I've completed ticket T003 by proposing an ESLint rule configuration to prevent internal mocking in test files, enforcing the project's "No Internal Mocking" policy.

## Key Deliverables

1. **Implementation Plan**: A detailed approach for implementing the ESLint rule in `T003-implementation.md`
2. **Rule Configuration**: Specific ESLint configuration to detect and prevent internal mocking
3. **Test Case**: A sample test file demonstrating what the rule would detect
4. **Limitations & Considerations**: Documentation of any limitations and alternative approaches

## Key Findings

1. **Best Approach**: Using `eslint-plugin-jest` with its `no-restricted-jest-methods` rule is the most effective way to prevent internal mocking
2. **Coverage**: The proposed solution covers both `jest.mock()` and `jest.spyOn()` patterns
3. **Pattern-Based**: The rule is configured to match patterns for internal modules (e.g., `@/components/**`)
4. **Compatible**: The solution integrates well with the existing ESLint setup and flat config format

## Implementation Details

The implementation involves:

1. Installing `eslint-plugin-jest`
2. Adding a specific rule configuration to the ESLint config
3. Configuring path patterns to prevent mocking of internal modules
4. Providing clear error messages that reference the policy

## Validation

To validate the rule works correctly, I created `test-internal-mocking.test.tsx` with examples of internal mocking patterns that should be detected when the rule is implemented.

## Next Steps

To fully implement this solution:

1. Install `eslint-plugin-jest` package
2. Update the ESLint configuration as proposed
3. Run ESLint to confirm the rule works as expected
4. Remove the test violation file
5. Document the rule and policy in appropriate documentation
