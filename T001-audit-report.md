# T001: Internal Mocking Audit Report

## Files Audited
- `__tests__/components/ui/container.test.tsx`
- `__tests__/components/ui/logo.test.tsx`
- `__tests__/components/ui/noise-background.test.tsx`

## Mocking Patterns Searched
1. Direct mocking with `jest.mock`
2. Spies with `jest.spyOn`
3. Mock implementations with `mockImplementation`/`mockReturnValue`
4. Manual mock functions replacing internal functionality

## Findings

### Active Internal Mocks
None found in the audited files.

### Commented-Out Internal Mocks
None found in the audited files, contrary to the code review mention of a commented-out `jest.mock` for `cn` utility in `container.test.tsx:12-15`.

### Acceptable Mock Usage
The only jest-related code found in these files is:
- Importing jest-dom and jest-axe for testing
- Creating mock functions for event handlers with `jest.fn()`, which is acceptable as these are not internal collaborators

### Other Test Files
While outside the scope of this specific audit task, the following test files were found to contain mocks of internal modules:
- `__tests__/components/ui/button.test.tsx` - Mocks `@/lib/utils`
- `__tests__/components/ui/input.test.tsx` - Mocks `@/lib/utils`
- `__tests__/components/ui/theme-toggle-button.test.tsx` - Mocks `@/components/ui/theme-provider` and `@/lib/utils`
- `__tests__/components/ui/typography.test.tsx` - Mocks `@/lib/utils`

These files should be addressed in a separate task as they were not part of the current audit scope.

## Conclusion
The three specified test files (`container.test.tsx`, `logo.test.tsx`, and `noise-background.test.tsx`) are compliant with the "No Internal Mocking" policy. No violations were found, and no changes were required.

## PR Description Update
The audit has been completed, and no violations of the "No Internal Mocking" policy were found in the specified test files. Specifically, there is no commented-out `jest.mock` for the `cn` utility in `container.test.tsx` as mentioned in the code review - it appears this issue may have been addressed in a previous commit.
