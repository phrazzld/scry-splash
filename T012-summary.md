# T012: Replace manual class checks in Logo tests with toHaveClass - Summary

## Implementation Summary

The task to replace manual class checks in Logo tests with the idiomatic `toHaveClass` method has been successfully completed. This refactoring improves the test quality by making it more standardized and resilient.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Direct Access to className Property**:
   - Eliminated all instances of accessing the `className` property directly
   - Replaced comparisons of `className` values with proper assertions
   - Removed string manipulation on class names

2. **Replaced Manual Class Checks with toHaveClass**:
   - Replaced `element.className.toContain('class-name')` with `expect(element).toHaveClass('class-name')`
   - Used the more robust `toHaveClass()` matcher for all class assertions

3. **Improved Testing of Multiple Classes**:
   - Used `toHaveClass()` with multiple classes and the `exact: false` option
   - Example: `expect(element).toHaveClass('class1 class2', { exact: false })`

4. **Enhanced Class Difference Testing**:
   - Rewrote tests that compared classNames between elements
   - Implemented a more robust methodology using Set operations to check for class differences
   - Added helper functions to extract class sets from elements

5. **Simplified Test Structure**:
   - Refactored tests to render multiple variants at once instead of using rerender
   - This approach makes the tests more readable and less prone to errors

## Benefits

1. **Improved Error Messages**: The `toHaveClass()` matcher provides more descriptive error messages when tests fail, making debugging easier.

2. **More Idiomatic Testing**: The refactored tests follow React Testing Library's recommended patterns for class assertions.

3. **Resilience to Implementation Changes**: The tests are now more focused on behavior rather than implementation details.

4. **Better Maintainability**: The code is cleaner and follows consistent patterns, making it easier to maintain.

## Verification

All tests remain green after the refactoring, confirming that the functionality is preserved while improving the test code quality.
