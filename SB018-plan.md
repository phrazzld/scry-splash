# SB018 - Refactor page.tsx to use the component library

## Task Analysis

After examining the current implementation of app/page.tsx and the component library, I've found that:

1. The app/page.tsx file is already using the SplashPage component from the component library
2. The SplashPage component already composes various molecules (HeroSection, BenefitTrio, CTASection) and uses the PageLayout organism

The current implementation appears to already fulfill the main requirement of using the component library. However, there might be opportunities for enhancement:

1. Adding metadata and improved SEO attributes
2. Adding analytics event handling
3. Ensuring proper a11y attributes throughout
4. Ensuring the implementation is fully responsive

## Verification Steps

1. Check if there are any custom styles or behaviors in the current page.tsx that need to be preserved
2. Verify that all a11y requirements are being met by the component implementations
3. Check if SplashPage properly uses all the components according to our design system
4. Ensure that there's visual parity with any original design

## Implementation Plan

Given that page.tsx is already using the SplashPage component correctly, this task may be primarily focused on ensuring that all a11y issues are addressed and that there is visual parity with the original design.

1. Review the SplashPage implementation for any a11y issues
2. Review the metadata for SEO optimization
3. Add any missing analytics hooks if needed 
4. Test the page at various viewport sizes to ensure responsive behavior

## Success Criteria

1. The page uses the component library (already fulfilled)
2. All a11y issues are addressed 
3. Visual parity with the original design is maintained
4. Page is fully responsive across all viewport sizes
