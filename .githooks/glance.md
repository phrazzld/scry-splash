## Technical Overview: `/Users/phaedrus/Development/scry/scry-splash/.githooks`

This directory houses Git hook scripts, specifically designed to automate tasks immediately after a `git commit` operation within the `scry-splash` project. The purpose of these hooks is to enhance the development workflow by triggering background processes without blocking the user's terminal.

**Purpose:**

The primary goal of the `.githooks` directory is to provide automated actions triggered by Git events.  In this case, the focus is on post-commit actions, specifically running a tool called `glance` in the background. This implies that `glance` performs some form of analysis or processing on the committed changes.

**Architecture:**

The architecture is simple: a single `post-commit` script.  Git automatically executes scripts located in the `.git/hooks` directory (or a symlinked directory specified by `core.hooksPath` in the Git configuration) after the corresponding Git event occurs.  The `post-commit` script is designed to be non-blocking, ensuring a fast commit process for the user.  It achieves this by launching `glance` in the background.

**Key File Roles:**

*   **`post-commit`:** This is a shell script executed by Git immediately after a successful `git commit`. Its role is to initiate `glance` in the background.  It uses `nohup` to ensure that the `glance` process continues to run even if the user closes their terminal.  The redirection of standard output and standard error to `/dev/null` indicates a desire to suppress any output from `glance` in the user's terminal. The `echo` statement provides feedback to the user, confirming that the background task has started.

**Dependencies and Gotchas:**

*   **`glance`:** The script relies on the availability of an executable named `glance` in the system's `PATH`.  The functionality of the hook is entirely dependent on the correct installation and operation of `glance`. Without it, the script will likely fail silently, potentially impacting the intended post-commit processing.
*   **Permissions:** The `post-commit` script must have execute permissions for Git to run it.
*   **Background Processes:** While the script aims to be non-blocking, poorly performing or crashing `glance` instances could still impact system resources. There is no error handling or process management beyond launching `glance`.
*   **Git Configuration:**  The standard location for hooks is `.git/hooks`.  For these hooks to be used, they either need to be in that directory, or the `core.hooksPath` Git configuration variable needs to point to this `.githooks` directory.
*   **Hidden Directory:** The `.githooks` directory and its contents are typically not tracked by Git directly. A mechanism (e.g., a script or a manual process) is likely needed to copy or symlink the scripts into the `.git/hooks` directory of each repository where they should be active. Without such a mechanism, the hook will not function.
