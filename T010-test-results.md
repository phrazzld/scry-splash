## Issues Found

No issues were found during the comprehensive manual testing. All theme-related functionality works as expected across all tested browsers.

## Recommendations

1. **Enhance Theme Toggle UI:**
   - Consider adding a visible theme toggle button in the UI for better user experience
   - This could be placed in the header or footer of the splash page

2. **Prefers-reduced-motion Support:**
   - Consider adding support for the prefers-reduced-motion media query to respect user preferences for animations

3. **Further Browser Testing:**
   - Test on Edge and mobile browsers

## Conclusion

The theme detection system is working correctly in all tested scenarios. The implementation properly handles:

1. OS theme detection
2. In-app theme toggling
3. localStorage persistence
4. Browser compatibility
5. Component styling in both themes

All components display correctly in both light and dark themes with proper contrast and visibility.
