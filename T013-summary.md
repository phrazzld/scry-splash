# T013 Implementation Summary

## Task
T013 - Robustly assert NoiseBackground styles and document jsdom limitations

## Background
The NoiseBackground component test file contained non-idiomatic style assertions that accessed DOM properties directly. These assertions were brittle and could break if implementation details changed. Additionally, there were challenges with testing backgroundImage styles due to JSDOM limitations.

## Changes Made
1. Replaced direct DOM style property access with React Testing Library's `toHaveStyle()` matcher:
   - Changed `noiseBg.style.backgroundColor` to `expect(noiseBg).toHaveStyle({ backgroundColor: customColor })`
   - Changed `noiseLayer.style.opacity` to `expect(noiseLayer).toHaveStyle({ opacity: customOpacity.toString() })`

2. Added comprehensive documentation about JSDOM limitations for testing backgroundImage:
   ```javascript
   // JSDOM LIMITATION: Testing CSS and backgroundImage
   // --------------------------------------
   // JSDOM has significant limitations when testing CSS styles, especially for background-image:
   //
   // 1. Complex URL encoding: The background image uses a data URI with encoded SVG content.
   //    Testing frameworks can't reliably compare these complex encoded strings due to
   //    differences in how browsers and JSDOM normalize URLs.
   // ...
   ```

3. Modified the testing approach for backgroundImage properties:
   - Removed unreliable attempts to test the exact backgroundImage value
   - Added clear explanations about why certain style properties can't be reliably tested in JSDOM
   - Emphasized the importance of visual testing through Chromatic for catching styling issues

## Benefits
1. **More robust tests**: By using `toHaveStyle()` for style assertions, the tests are now more resilient to implementation changes and follow React Testing Library best practices.

2. **Clearer understanding of limitations**: The documentation clearly explains why certain style properties (specifically backgroundImage with data URIs) can't be reliably tested in JSDOM, helping future developers understand testing limitations.

3. **Better test maintainability**: The tests now focus on verifiable style properties like opacity and backgroundRepeat, while acknowledging that visual aspects should be verified through visual testing tools.

## Testing
All tests pass successfully after the changes.

## Next Steps
The next related task is T015, which focuses on minimizing data-testid usage in favor of more semantic selectors for all component tests, including NoiseBackground.
