# Plan: Enable Strict TypeScript Configuration (TS-001)

## Chosen Approach (One-liner)

Align Jest's TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.jest.json`) with the root strict settings (`tsconfig.json`) and systematically fix all resulting type errors, primarily within the test suite.

## Architecture Blueprint

-   **Modules / Packages**
    -   `tsconfig.json`: Root TypeScript configuration (already strict). Verify all recommended strict flags are enabled.
    -   `tsconfig.jest.json`: TypeScript configuration specifically for Jest tests. This will be modified to inherit strict settings and remove overrides.
    -   `src/`: Application source code (should already mostly comply with root strict config).
    -   `components/`: UI components (potential source of type errors, especially prop types).
    -   `__tests__/`: Test files (primary focus for fixing type errors introduced by stricter Jest config).
-   **Public Interfaces / Contracts**
    -   N/A for this configuration-focused task. Existing component prop types (`interface`, `type`) may require refinement during error fixing.
-   **Data Flow Diagram**
    -   N/A
-   **Error & Edge-Case Strategy**
    -   Errors will manifest as TypeScript compiler errors during `pnpm typecheck` and potentially during `pnpm test` runs via `ts-jest`.
    -   The strategy is to treat compiler errors as mandatory fixes before merging. No suppression directives (`@ts-ignore`, `as any` without justification) are allowed per `DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md`.

## Detailed Build Steps

1.  **Verify Root Config:** Confirm `tsconfig.json` contains `"strict": true` and enables all associated strict flags (`noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, etc.) as mandated by `DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY_APPENDIX_TYPESCRIPT.md`.
2.  **Modify Jest Config:** Update `tsconfig.jest.json` to properly extend the root `tsconfig.json`.
3.  **Remove Weakening Options:** Delete `"noImplicitAny": false` and any other options in `tsconfig.jest.json` that override or weaken the inherited strict settings. Ensure `"isolatedModules": false` remains if necessary for Jest, but investigate potential conflicts.
4.  **Run Local Type Check:** Execute `pnpm typecheck` locally to surface all TypeScript errors across the project, paying close attention to errors within the `__tests__` directory.
5.  **Run Local Tests:** Execute `pnpm test` locally to identify any test failures caused by type errors or necessary code changes during fixing.
6.  **Identify & Catalog Errors:** Create a temporary list or use IDE features to identify all files and specific lines causing TypeScript errors under the new strict configuration.
7.  **Fix Type Errors Systematically:**
    *   Iterate through the identified errors.
    *   Prioritize fixing `any` types by replacing them with specific types, unions, `unknown` (with type guards), or generics.
    *   Refine types for test mocks (e.g., Jest mock function signatures), component props in tests, and variables within test files.
    *   Address potential `strictNullChecks` errors by handling `null` and `undefined` explicitly where necessary.
    *   Ensure function parameters and return types are explicitly typed in test helpers and setup files.
8.  **Iterative Verification:** After fixing errors in a file or module, re-run `pnpm typecheck` and relevant tests (`pnpm test path/to/file.test.tsx`) to confirm fixes and ensure no regressions were introduced.
9.  **Final Verification:** Once all errors are addressed, run the full test suite (`pnpm test`) and type check (`pnpm typecheck`) again to ensure complete compliance.
10. **Commit Changes:** Commit the updated `tsconfig.jest.json` and all necessary code fixes with a clear commit message adhering to Conventional Commits (e.g., `fix(config): enforce strict typescript in jest tests`).
11. **CI Verification:** Push changes and ensure the CI pipeline (assuming implementation per AUTO-003) passes all type checking and testing stages.

## Testing Strategy

-   **Test Layers:** This task primarily impacts the **unit/integration** test layer, as the main goal is to enforce strict typing within the test code itself (`*.test.tsx`).
-   **What to Mock:** This plan does not introduce new mocks. Existing mocks, especially those for components or functions, may need more precise type definitions (e.g., using `jest.MockedFunction`). Adhere strictly to the mocking policy (no internal mocks).
-   **Coverage Targets:** Maintain existing test coverage targets as defined in `DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY_APPENDIX_FRONTEND.md` (e.g., 90%+ for atoms/molecules). Fixing type errors should not decrease coverage; add tests if refactoring significantly alters component structure.

## Logging & Observability

-   N/A for this task.

## Security & Config

-   **Input Validation Hotspots:** N/A directly, although stricter typing contributes to overall code robustness by preventing type-related bugs.
-   **Secrets Handling:** N/A.
-   **Least-Privilege Notes:** N/A.

## Documentation

-   **Code Self-Doc:** Fixing `any` types and adding explicit types improves self-documentation within the test suite.
-   **README/CONTRIBUTING Updates:** Briefly note in `CONTRIBUTING.md` or a relevant development guide that tests are now subject to the same strict TypeScript rules as application code.

## Risk Matrix

| :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Existing tests fail due to newly enforced strict type rules.         | High     | Run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` locally after config changes. Systematically fix all reported TypeScript errors before committing. |
| Fixing type errors inadvertently introduces logic bugs in tests.      | Medium   | Rely on existing test assertions to catch regressions. Perform thorough code reviews of changes made during type fixing.                   |
| Significant development time required to fix numerous type errors.     | Medium   | Address errors file-by-file or component-by-component. Prioritize fixes based on error type (e.g., `any` types first).                 |
| Difficulty in accurately typing complex test mocks or dependencies.  | Medium   | Use `jest.MockedFunction`, `jest.MockedClass`, etc. Utilize `unknown` with type guards. Avoid `any`. Refer to library type definitions. |
| `tsconfig.jest.json` inheritance conflicts with root `tsconfig.json`. | Low      | Carefully review inherited options. Ensure Jest-specific overrides (like potentially `isolatedModules`) do not compromise strictness.    |
