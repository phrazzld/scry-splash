# CI Failure Summary

## Overview
The E2E tests in the GitHub Actions workflow are failing. The failures occur in all Playwright E2E tests in the CTA flow and the splash page visual tests.

## Build Information
- **Branch**: `test/test-002-e2e-setup`
- **Latest Commit**: `75e4d1ee360c065ede4442ed0ca7e11835413d13` (Merge commit)
- **Run ID**: `15144691667`
- **Workflow**: E2E Tests
- **Environment**: Ubuntu 24.04 (GitHub Actions runner)

## Failed Tests (4 of 5 tests failed)
1. `[chromium] › e2e/tests/cta-flow.spec.ts:20:3 › CTA Flow › happy path - successful email submission`
2. `[chromium] › e2e/tests/cta-flow.spec.ts:101:3 › CTA Flow › client-side invalid email validation`
3. `[chromium] › e2e/tests/cta-flow.spec.ts:172:3 › CTA Flow › mocked server error - displays error message`
4. `[chromium] › e2e/tests/splash-page-load.spec.ts:55:3 › Splash Page Load Tests › should take a visual screenshot of the splash page`

## Error Analysis

### Root Cause
The primary issue appears to be related to missing debug directories in the CI environment despite the test setup module being implemented. While directories are created in the GitHub workflow configuration (.github/workflows/e2e.yml), there seems to be a timing or ownership issue with these directories during test execution.

Specific issues:
1. Debug artifacts aren't being created or accessed properly
2. The test setup module is being called correctly, but the directory structure may not be accessible
3. The test infrastructure utilities (debug-helpers.ts, enhanced-testing.ts) seem to have duplicate or conflicting implementations
4. The visual test comparison for the splash page is failing, likely due to rendering differences in the CI environment

### Key Findings
1. **Debug Directory Issues**: The GitHub workflow creates debug directories on line 78-80, but upload steps are failing to find artifacts (error: "No files were found with the provided path")
2. **Duplicate Implementation**: There appears to be overlap between functions in:
   - `e2e/utils/test-setup.ts`
   - `e2e/utils/debug-helpers.ts`
   - `e2e/utils/enhanced-testing.ts`

3. **Test Setup Timing**: The newly added setupTestEnvironment function is called at module load time in each test file but may be executing too late in the CI environment

4. **Visual Test Failures**: The screenshot comparison test is failing, which might indicate rendering differences or timing issues with animations

## Affected Components
1. **E2E Test Infrastructure**:
   - Test setup module
   - Debug directory handling
   - Error reporting system

2. **CI Configuration**:
   - Directory creation and permissions
   - Artifact collection

3. **Test Execution Environment**:
   - Browser rendering
   - Network conditions in CI

## Recent Changes
The most relevant recent changes that may have contributed to the failures:
1. Implementation of the test setup module (CI-T010)
2. Addition of dependency caching to CI workflow (CI-T009)
3. Added data-testid attributes for reliable message detection (commit: 865ec8a)
4. Added comprehensive debugging for CI test failures (commit: 1e18235)

## Artifacts
- Playwright HTML report: Available at `https://github.com/phrazzld/scry-splash/actions/runs/15144691667/artifacts/3162434150`
- Playwright failures: Available at `https://github.com/phrazzld/scry-splash/actions/runs/15144691667/artifacts/3162434447`
- Debug screenshots and logs: No artifacts found, which is part of the problem

## Timeline
- Test execution started: 2025-05-20T18:06:36.637Z
- Test execution completed: 2025-05-20T18:08:47.680Z
- Total execution time: ~2 minutes 11 seconds

## Additional Context
The changes made to improve E2E test reliability and debugging are moving in the right direction, but there appears to be an issue with how the debug directories are created and accessed in the CI environment. The test infrastructure might need better synchronization between the GitHub Actions workflow directory setup and the test environment initialization.
