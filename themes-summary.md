# Theme System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation, testing, and improvements made to the Scry splash page theme system, covering tasks T010, T013, and T014.

## Theme Implementation

The theming system has been implemented with these key components:

1. **ThemeProvider** (`components/ui/theme-provider.tsx`)
   - Context provider to manage theme state (dark/light/system)
   - Handles system theme detection and localStorage persistence
   - Provides theme toggle functionality

2. **ThemeScript** (`components/ui/theme-script.tsx`)
   - Anti-FOUC script that runs before React hydration
   - Reads theme from localStorage or system preference
   - Applies correct theme class to HTML element immediately

3. **CSS Variables** (`app/theme.css`)
   - Root variables for base colors and typography
   - Theme-specific tokens for dark and light modes
   - Semantic variables that map to design tokens

4. **Tailwind Configuration** (`tailwind.config.js`)
   - `darkMode: ["class"]` for class-based dark mode
   - Extended theme with custom colors and typography

## Testing Results

### Theme Switching and Detection
- System theme detection works correctly
- Manual theme switching via UI works as expected
- localStorage persistence ensures theme choice remains across sessions
- Anti-FOUC script prevents flashing of incorrect theme during page load

### Accessibility Improvements
- Fixed placeholder text contrast in dark mode (increased opacity to 0.8)
- Added ARIA labels to theme toggle buttons for screen readers
- Enhanced focus states for all interactive elements
- Verified contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Code Cleanup
- Added feature flags to conditionally show theme testing components
- Ensured code is clean and production-ready
- Maintained appropriate console.warn for error handling
- No extraneous commented-out code or debugging statements

## Development Tools
Two components were added to assist with theme development:

1. **ThemeSwitch** (`components/ui/theme-switch.tsx`)
   - UI for toggling between dark, light, and system themes
   - Shows currently selected theme and system preference

2. **ThemeDebug** (`components/ui/theme-debug.tsx`)
   - Displays current theme context state
   - Shows computed CSS variables
   - Provides DOM state information (HTML classes, data-theme attribute)

These tools can be easily disabled in production by setting the corresponding flags in `app/page.tsx` to false.

## Remaining Theme-Related Tasks
- T011: Add Automated E2E Theme Tests
- T012: Add Unit/Integration Tests for Theme Hook/Context
- T015: Update Documentation
- T016: Verify/Update Storybook Stories

## Conclusion
The theme system is robust, accessible, and ready for use. It correctly handles system preferences, manual selection, and persistence while being visually consistent and accessible in both light and dark modes.
