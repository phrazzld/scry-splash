# T027 Summary - Fix React act() warnings in CTASection tests

## Changes Made

I updated the `__tests__/components/molecules/cta-section.test.tsx` file to properly wrap React state updates in `act()` calls. This fixes the warnings that were appearing during test runs, where state updates were occurring outside of act().

The key changes were:

1. Imported the `act` function from `@testing-library/react`:
   ```diff
   - import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
   + import { render, screen, fireEvent, act } from '@testing-library/react';
   ```

2. Properly wrapped all asynchronous form submissions and state updates in `act()`:
   ```tsx
   // For form input changes
   await act(async () => {
     fireEvent.change(input, { target: { value: 'test@example.com' } });
   });
   
   // For form submissions with async state updates
   await act(async () => {
     fireEvent.submit(form);
     
     // Wait for all promises in the microtask queue to resolve
     await Promise.resolve();
     
     // For tests with fetch mock responses
     await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 0));
   });
   ```

3. This ensures all state updates (`setSubmitStatus`, `setInputValue`, and `setIsSubmitting`) that occur in response to these events are properly contained within `act()` calls.

## Verification

I ran the tests for the CTASection component and verified:
- All 17 tests are now passing
- There are no more React act() warnings in the console output

These changes ensure the tests more accurately reflect how React updates the UI in response to events in a real browser, making the tests more accurate and reliable.
