```

This directory serves as a repository for static asset files, specifically SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) images, used within the Scry Splash stories. The primary purpose of these assets is to visually enhance the user interface and provide recognizable icons for various functionalities or integrations.

**Architecture:**

The directory follows a flat structure, directly containing the SVG files. There are no subdirectories or complex organizational patterns. Each SVG file represents a distinct visual element.

**Key File Roles:**

*   `youtube.svg`: Provides the YouTube icon, likely intended for linking to or representing YouTube-related content/functionality.
*   `accessibility.svg`: Offers an icon representing accessibility features or settings.
*   `discord.svg`: Contains the Discord icon, potentially used for integration with Discord or linking to a Discord community.
*   `github.svg`: Supplies the GitHub icon, likely for representing GitHub repositories or related actions.
*   `tutorials.svg`: Provides an icon representing tutorials or learning resources.

**Dependencies/Gotchas:**

*   **Dependency:** The components utilizing these assets depend on these SVG files being present in this directory and accessible via the correct file path. Any renaming or relocation of these files necessitates corresponding updates in the consuming components.
*   **Gotcha:** The visual appearance of these icons is directly tied to the SVG code itself. Modifications to the SVG code within these files directly impact the rendered appearance. Ensure consistency in styling and adherence to design guidelines when modifying these SVG files.
*   **Gotcha:** These files are likely optimized for a specific size. Using them at significantly different sizes could lead to rendering artifacts (blurriness, pixelation) if the consuming component doesn't handle scaling well.
*   **Gotcha:** Color definitions are embedded within the SVG files. Changing the branding colors would require manually editing the color values within each relevant SVG file.
