# Quality Gate Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration from individual CI workflows to a consolidated Quality Gate pipeline, implemented to enforce mandatory code quality standards and streamline the development process.

## What Changed

### Consolidated CI Pipeline

**Before**: Multiple independent GitHub Actions workflows

- `typecheck.yml` - TypeScript type checking
- `test-coverage.yml` - Test execution and coverage reporting
- `e2e.yml` - End-to-end testing
- Individual workflows ran independently with potential for inconsistent results

**After**: Single comprehensive `quality-gate.yml` workflow

- **Stage 1: Setup & Lint** - Environment setup, Prettier formatting, ESLint analysis
- **Stage 2: Type & Test** - TypeScript checking, Jest tests with coverage validation
- **Stage 3: Security & E2E** - Dependency auditing, Playwright end-to-end tests
- Sequential execution with fail-fast behavior for early issue detection

### Coverage Enforcement

**Before**: Coverage monitoring without strict enforcement

- Coverage reports generated but not blocking
- Inconsistent coverage standards across components

**After**: Mandatory coverage thresholds with component-specific requirements

- **Global Minimum**: 75% statements, 80% branches, 85% functions, 75% lines
- **UI Components**: 80% statements, 50% branches, 85% functions, 80% lines
- **Molecules**: 60% statements, 65% branches, 65% functions, 60% lines
- **Organisms**: 90% statements, 90% branches, 90% functions, 90% lines
- **Lib Utilities**: 100% all metrics
- CI builds fail if coverage thresholds are not met

### Security Integration

**New**: Dependency vulnerability scanning

- Automated `pnpm audit` execution in CI
- Blocks merges on high/critical severity vulnerabilities
- Medium severity vulnerabilities logged as warnings

## Impact on Developer Workflow

### Pull Request Process

**Before**:

- Multiple status checks to monitor
- Possible for some checks to pass while others fail
- Inconsistent quality enforcement

**After**:

- Single "Quality Gate" status check
- All-or-nothing approach - entire pipeline must pass
- Clear failure points with actionable error messages

### Local Development

**Enhanced validation commands**:

```bash
# Stage 1 equivalent
pnpm prettier --check .
pnpm lint

# Stage 2 equivalent
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test --coverage

# Stage 3 equivalent
pnpm audit --audit-level=high --prod
pnpm build
```

### Debugging Failures

**Improved debugging**:

- Clear stage separation shows exactly where failures occur
- Fail-fast behavior prevents wasted CI time on later stages
- Consistent error messaging across all checks

## Migration Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Quality Gate workflow deployed alongside existing workflows
- **Phase 2**: Branch protection updated to require Quality Gate workflow
- **Phase 3**: Legacy workflows removed (`typecheck.yml`, `test-coverage.yml`, `e2e.yml`)
- **Phase 4**: Documentation updated to reflect new process

## Rollback Procedure

If issues arise with the Quality Gate workflow:

1. **Immediate**: Disable quality-gate.yml workflow

   ```bash
   # Rename workflow file to disable
   mv .github/workflows/quality-gate.yml .github/workflows/quality-gate.yml.disabled
   ```

2. **Restore legacy workflows** (if needed):

   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- .github/workflows/typecheck.yml
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- .github/workflows/test-coverage.yml
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- .github/workflows/e2e.yml
   ```

3. **Update branch protection** to require legacy workflows instead

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Coverage Threshold Failures

**Problem**: Tests pass but coverage check fails
**Solution**:

- Run `pnpm test --coverage` locally to see coverage report
- Add tests for uncovered lines, branches, or functions
- Focus on the specific component type thresholds

### Security Audit Failures

**Problem**: High/critical vulnerabilities block CI
**Solution**:

- Run `pnpm audit` locally to see vulnerability details
- Update vulnerable dependencies: `pnpm update`
- If updates don't resolve issues, investigate alternative packages

### E2E Test Failures

**Problem**: End-to-end tests fail in CI but pass locally
**Solution**:

- Check CI environment variables are set correctly
- Verify browser installation and environment setup
- Review test logs for environment-specific issues

## Benefits Realized

1. **Consistency**: Single source of truth for quality requirements
2. **Efficiency**: Fail-fast behavior saves CI time and resources
3. **Clarity**: Clear stages show exactly where issues occur
4. **Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning prevents security issues
5. **Coverage**: Enforced coverage thresholds improve code quality
6. **Maintainability**: Single workflow easier to maintain than multiple files

## Documentation Updates

All project documentation has been updated to reflect the new process:

- **README.md**: Added Quality Gate status badge and updated CI/CD section
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Added quality gates section with local validation commands
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated with quality gate information and coverage thresholds
