# T022 · Chore · P1: Ensure TSDoc Coverage for Container Props - Summary

## Changes Made

1. Enhanced the main Container component documentation:
   - Added more detailed description of the component's purpose
   - Included an example showing typical usage

2. Added comprehensive TSDoc for the ContainerProps interface:
   - Added an interface-level description explaining the Container component's purpose
   - Documented each prop with:
     - Clear descriptions of what each prop does
     - Default values where applicable
     - Type information and valid values
     - Explanations of how props interact with each other

3. Specifically documented the following props:
   - `as`: Allows rendering as a different HTML element (default: "div")
   - `maxWidth`: Maximum width constraint with various options (default: "xl")
   - `padding`: Horizontal padding with size options (default: "md")
   - `center`: Controls horizontal centering (default: false)
   - `gap`: Grid gap spacing in both directions (default: "md")
   - `gapX`: Horizontal-only grid gap spacing (overrides gap)
   - `gapY`: Vertical-only grid gap spacing (overrides gap)

## Verification

- Ran TypeScript type checking: No errors
- Ran linter: No warnings or errors
- Verified TSDoc comments follow standard format and conventions
- Ensured documentation is clear, concise, and provides valuable information

## Benefits

1. **Improved Developer Experience**: Props are now well-documented with clear descriptions and default values, making the component easier to use correctly.

2. **Better IDE Integration**: The documentation will appear in IDE tooltips when hovering over props, providing immediate guidance to developers.

3. **Maintainability**: Future developers will better understand the purpose and behavior of each prop, reducing the risk of regression or misuse.

4. **Documentation as Code**: The TSDoc comments serve as self-documenting code, ensuring the documentation stays with the component and remains up-to-date.
