# T029 Summary - Set Up Chromatic Project Token

## Problem Statement

The CI pipeline was failing due to a missing Chromatic project token, preventing visual regression testing from running. The GitHub Actions workflow was properly configured to use `${{ secrets.CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN }}`, but the secret wasn't defined in the repository settings.

## Actions Taken

1. **Analyzed the Current Configuration**:
   - Examined the `.github/workflows/chromatic.yml` file to confirm it correctly references the Chromatic token
   - Verified Storybook and Chromatic are properly set up in the project with necessary dependencies

2. **Documented the Token Setup Process**:
   - Created detailed instructions for obtaining a Chromatic project token
   - Outlined the steps to add the token as a GitHub repository secret
   - Documented how to verify the workflow is correctly referencing the token

3. **Created Comprehensive Documentation**:
   - Added a new file `docs/CHROMATIC_SETUP.md` with detailed information about:
     - What Chromatic is and how it's used in the project
     - How to run Chromatic locally with various options
     - The CI configuration and workflow triggers
     - How to set up Chromatic on a new environment
     - Instructions for reviewing visual changes
     - Troubleshooting common issues

## Implementation Notes

The implementation focuses on security best practices:
- The token is stored as a GitHub secret, not hardcoded in the workflow
- Documentation doesn't include the actual token value
- Clear instructions are provided for authorized team members to set up the token

Since this is a configuration task that requires administrative access to both Chromatic and the GitHub repository settings, the actual token setup will need to be completed by someone with appropriate permissions. The documentation provided has all the necessary information to complete this process.

## Verification Steps

Once the token is added to GitHub secrets, verification can be done by:
1. Pushing a small change that affects components or stories
2. Monitoring the GitHub Actions workflow execution
3. Verifying the Chromatic step completes successfully

## Next Steps

1. A repository administrator should:
   - Create a Chromatic account and project if not already done
   - Obtain the project token
   - Add it to GitHub repository secrets as `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN`

2. After configuration:
   - Run a test build to verify the token works correctly
   - Notify the team that visual testing is now active
