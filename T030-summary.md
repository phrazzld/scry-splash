# T030 Summary - Document Testing Strategy and Separation

## Changes Made

I created a comprehensive testing documentation file at `/docs/TESTING.md` that provides a clear explanation of the project's testing strategy, covering:

1. **Testing Architecture**: Describes the multi-layered testing approach using Jest, Playwright, Chromatic and jest-axe

2. **Directory Structure**: Provides an overview of where different types of tests are located

3. **Jest Tests**:
   - Configuration details from jest.config.js
   - Guidelines for writing component tests
   - Example component test with accessibility checks
   - Information on testing hooks and context

4. **Playwright End-to-End Tests**:
   - Configuration details from playwright.config.ts
   - Guidelines for writing E2E tests
   - Example E2E test for theme switching
   - Browser compatibility considerations

5. **Test Coverage**:
   - Target and current thresholds
   - How to measure and enforce coverage
   - Integration with CI pipeline and pre-push hook

6. **Running Tests**:
   - Commands for running Jest tests
   - Commands for running Playwright tests
   - Options for test modes and reporting

7. **Mocking Strategy**:
   - Guidelines for mocking external dependencies
   - Recommendations for internal modules
   - Best practices for maintaining testability

8. **Best Practices**:
   - When to use Jest vs. Playwright
   - Test organization guidelines
   - Writing resilient tests that focus on behavior
   - Using semantic queries over implementation details

9. **Integration with Other Testing Documents**:
   - Links to existing A11Y_TESTING.md, VISUAL_TESTING.md and CHROMATIC_SETUP.md
   - Explanation of how they all fit together in the testing strategy

10. **Troubleshooting**:
    - Common issues with Jest tests and solutions
    - Common issues with Playwright tests and solutions

## Implementation Details

The documentation was created based on:
- Analysis of existing jest.config.js and playwright.config.ts files
- Examination of package.json scripts
- Study of the test directory structure
- Integration with existing documentation
- Examples reflecting actual code patterns in the codebase

The document is comprehensive yet practical, with code examples and commands that developers can copy and use. It clearly explains the separation between different types of tests and provides guidelines for when to use each approach.

## Impact

This documentation will:
- Clarify the testing architecture for new team members
- Establish consistent testing practices across the codebase
- Provide a clear reference for writing different types of tests
- Explain the rationale behind coverage thresholds
- Make it easier to understand how the different testing tools work together

The documentation is structured to be maintainable as the project evolves, with modular sections that can be updated independently.
