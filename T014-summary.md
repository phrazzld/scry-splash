# T014 Implementation Summary

## Task
T014 - Minimize data-testid usage in Logo tests in favor of user-facing queries

## Background
The Logo component tests were initially using data-testid attributes for selecting elements in the test environment. While this approach works reliably, it doesn't reflect how users actually interact with components and can couple tests to implementation details rather than behavior.

## Changes Made
1. Replaced `getByTestId()` with more semantic queries throughout the tests:
   - Used `getByRole('heading')` for the default h1 logo element
   - Used `getByLabelText()` to select elements by their aria-label
   - Used `getByTitle()` for elements with title attributes

2. Added descriptive aria-labels to distinguish between multiple instances of the Logo component in the same test

3. Improved test structure by using:
   - Consistent selectors based on semantic attributes
   - Clear patterns for verification of different element types

## Benefits
1. **More resilient tests**: The tests are now less coupled to implementation details and more focused on how users would interact with the component.

2. **Better accessibility focus**: By querying components the way users (including assistive technologies) would access them, we're validating that the component has proper semantic structure.

3. **Improved test maintainability**: Tests now reflect user interactions rather than artificial testing hooks, making them more stable across changes.

4. **Better testing example**: These tests now serve as better examples of React Testing Library best practices.

## Testing
All 35 tests pass successfully after the refactoring.

## Next Steps
The next related task is T015, which focuses on minimizing data-testid usage in Container, GridItem, and NoiseBackground tests, applying similar principles as this task.
