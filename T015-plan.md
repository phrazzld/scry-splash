# T015: Update Documentation

## Overview
This task involves documenting the theme implementation in both code comments and relevant documentation files. The goal is to ensure that the theme system is well-documented for future developers who need to understand or modify the theme functionality.

## Current Theme Implementation
The theme system consists of the following key components:
1. ThemeProvider (React context provider)
2. useTheme hook
3. ThemeScript (Anti-FOUC script)
4. Theme CSS variables
5. ThemeSwitch (manual theme toggle)
6. ThemeDebug (development tool)
7. Additional theme utility components

## Documentation Plan

### 1. Code Comments

Update the following files with comprehensive JSDoc and inline comments:

1. **theme-provider.tsx**:
   - Document the provider's purpose and overall functionality
   - Document each prop with detailed descriptions
   - Explain the state management logic
   - Document the context implementation
   - Add inline comments for complex logic

2. **theme-script.tsx**:
   - Document the Anti-FOUC script purpose and implementation
   - Explain the script's execution flow
   - Document each prop

3. **theme.css**:
   - Document CSS variable organization
   - Explain the theme token structure
   - Add comments for each section of CSS variables

4. **theme-switch.tsx** and **theme-debug.tsx**:
   - Document development/testing tools
   - Explain when and how to use these components

5. **Other theme-related components**:
   - Ensure all theme-related components have proper documentation

### 2. Create Theme Documentation File

Create a dedicated markdown file `docs/THEMING.md` that documents:

1. **Theme System Overview**:
   - Architectural decisions and design patterns
   - File structure and responsibilities
   - Relationship between components

2. **How the Theme System Works**:
   - Initial theme detection (system preference vs localStorage)
   - Theme switching and persistence
   - Anti-FOUC implementation
   - CSS variables and Tailwind integration

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Context provider implementation
   - Storage mechanisms
   - DOM manipulation

4. **Developer Guide**:
   - How to use the theme system in new components
   - How to add new theme tokens
   - Best practices for theme-aware styling
   - Testing theme-aware components

5. **Theme Development Tools**:
   - ThemeSwitch and ThemeDebug usage
   - Testing tools and methodology

## Implementation Approach

1. First review all existing code to understand the full theme implementation
2. Add JSDoc comments to all theme-related components
3. Add inline comments for complex logic
4. Create comprehensive THEMING.md document
5. Review and finalize all documentation
