# Task Description: Enable Strict TypeScript Configuration (TS-001)

## Overview
This task involves enhancing the TypeScript configuration in the Scry Splash project to enforce strict typing throughout the codebase. This will improve code quality and prevent potential runtime errors.

## Current State
- The root `tsconfig.json` already has `"strict": true` set
- However, `tsconfig.jest.json` (used for tests) has `"noImplicitAny": false` which weakens type checking
- This inconsistency means tests don't benefit from the same strict typing enforcement as the main codebase

## Task Requirements
As defined in BACKLOG.md (TS-001):
1. Configure root `tsconfig.json` with `"strict": true` and all recommended strictness options
2. Ensure `tsconfig.jest.json` extends the base config without weakening strictness
3. Remove `noImplicitAny: false` from Jest configuration

## Expected Outcome
- All TypeScript code compiles under `"strict": true` with no `any` types
- CI fails on type errors (to be implemented in a separate task AUTO-003)
- Both application code and test code maintain the same level of type safety

## Context
This task is a dependency for:
- **AUTO-003**: Implement mandatory code quality CI gates
  
Implementing strict typing is a critical foundation for overall code quality and will:
- Prevent runtime type errors 
- Improve IntelliSense and autocompletion
- Make refactoring safer
- Enforce better coding practices

## Implementation Considerations
1. **Approach options:**
   - Update configurations incrementally or all at once
   - Consider impact on existing code that may have implicit any types
   - Determine if temporary type assertions (`as any`) will be needed during migration

2. **Testing impact:**
   - How will this affect the test environment and mocking?
   - Will we need to update any test utilities?

3. **Code modifications:**
   - What parts of the codebase might need updates to comply with stricter rules?
   - How to handle third-party libraries without good TypeScript definitions?

4. **Risks:**
   - Potential breaking changes
   - Developer workflow disruption

## Request for Thinktank
Please provide a detailed implementation plan for enabling strict TypeScript configuration, including:
1. Specific changes needed in configuration files
2. Strategy for handling existing code that may not comply
3. Testing approach to ensure no regressions
4. Step-by-step implementation plan
5. Risk mitigation strategies
