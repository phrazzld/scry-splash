# T018 · Chore · P2: Remove Commented-Out Dead jest.mock Code Summary

## Investigation

After thoroughly examining the `container.test.tsx` file, I found that the commented-out `jest.mock` code mentioned in the ticket has already been removed in a previous commit.

The git history shows that the file previously contained the following code at the beginning of the file:

```typescript
// Mock the cn utility function
jest.mock('@/lib/utils', () => ({
  cn: (...args: any[]) => args.filter(Boolean).join(' ')
}));
```

This code has been removed and is no longer present in the current version of the file.

## Verification

1. Performed a grep search for `jest.mock` in the `container.test.tsx` file
2. Checked for any commented-out code in the file
3. Examined the git history which confirmed the code was already removed

## Conclusion

The task T018 can be marked as completed as the commented-out `jest.mock` code has already been removed from `container.test.tsx`. No further action is required.
