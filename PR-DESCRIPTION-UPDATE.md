# Internal Mocking Policy Confirmation

## No Internal Mocking Policy Audit

I confirm that a thorough audit has been performed on the following UI component test files:
- `__tests__/components/ui/container.test.tsx`
- `__tests__/components/ui/logo.test.tsx`
- `__tests__/components/ui/noise-background.test.tsx`

The audit specifically searched for:
1. Direct mocking with `jest.mock` of internal modules
2. Spying on module functions with `jest.spyOn`
3. Manual mock implementations replacing internal functionality
4. Module factory replacements

**Result:** No violations of the "No Internal Mocking" policy were found in any of these files. The only Jest-related code identified was:
- Importing jest-dom and jest-axe for testing
- Creating mock functions for event handlers with `jest.fn()`, which is acceptable as these are not internal collaborators

Regarding the specific issue mentioned in the code review about a commented-out `jest.mock` for the `cn` utility in `container.test.tsx:12-15`, this was not found in the current codebase and appears to have been already addressed in a previous commit.

A detailed audit report has been documented in `T001-audit-report.md`.

This confirmation satisfies ticket T002 and addresses the critical policy violation risk identified in the code review (cr-02).
