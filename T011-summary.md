# T011: Decouple Logo tests from CSS class implementation details - Summary

## Implementation Summary

The task to decouple the Logo tests from CSS class implementation details has been successfully completed. The primary goal was to make the tests more resilient to changes in the internal implementation of the component's styles.

## Changes Made

1. **Size Variant Tests**: 
   - Refactored to check component behavior rather than specific class names
   - Instead of looking for class names like `text-display` or `text-body`, we now:
     - Verify that components with different size props render successfully
     - Check that size props are processed correctly (not passed to DOM)
     - Verify that all variants maintain required base classes

2. **Color Variant Tests**:
   - Replaced direct color class checks with a more resilient approach
   - Now we verify that:
     - Different color props result in different class names
     - The color prop is properly processed and not passed to DOM
     - Each color variant generates a distinct className

3. **Documentation**:
   - Added clear comments explaining JSDOM limitations for style testing
   - Documented the rationale for our testing approach
   - Added notes about the inability to check computed styles directly

## Benefits of the Approach

1. **More Resilient Tests**: Tests now focus on component behavior rather than implementation details, making them less brittle to internal changes.

2. **Better Testing Practices**: The updated tests align with React Testing Library's philosophy of testing "user-centric behavior" rather than implementation details.

3. **Documentation**: Comments throughout the tests now explain the limitations of JSDOM and the reasoning behind testing approaches.

4. **Maintainability**: The tests now better accommodate future refactoring of the component's styling implementation.

## Verification

All tests remain green after refactoring, indicating that the component's behavior is properly validated while being decoupled from specific implementation details.
