# Task Description

## Issue Details

**Issue #12: Implement mandatory code quality CI gates (AUTO-003)**
URL: https://github.com/phrazzld/scry-splash/issues/12

## Overview

Automate linting, testing, and type-checking to ensure consistent quality and prevent regressions by implementing mandatory CI gates that enforce code quality standards.

## Requirements

- Configure CI (GitHub Actions) to run linting, type checking (`"strict": true` enforced), and all tests (unit, integration, E2E) on every pull request and push to main branch
- The CI pipeline must _fail_ if any checks do not pass
- Implement and enforce test coverage thresholds (e.g., 90%+ for atoms/molecules, 85%+ for organisms, 100% for critical E2E flows) within the CI pipeline; build fails if thresholds are not met
- Integrate coverage reporting (e.g., Codecov, Coveralls) for visibility

## Technical Context

This is a **critical priority** infrastructure task that enables other quality measures. The project currently has:

- TypeScript with strict configuration
- ESLint and Prettier configured
- Jest for testing with coverage
- Playwright for E2E testing
- pnpm as package manager
- Pre-commit hooks already configured

## Related Issues

Dependencies mentioned:

- TS-001 (TypeScript strict mode - likely already implemented)
- TEST-001 (Core UI atom tests - marked completed)
- TEST-002 (E2E testing setup - marked completed)
