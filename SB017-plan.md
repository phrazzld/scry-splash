# SB017 - Implement a11y testing in Storybook

## Task Overview
- Configure the a11y addon for all stories
- Ensure all components pass WCAG AA standards

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Confirm a11y addon is properly installed
- The package.json already shows `@storybook/addon-a11y` is installed
- Need to verify it's properly set up in Storybook configuration

### 2. Configure a11y addon for all stories
- Check the Storybook configuration in `.storybook/main.ts` to ensure the addon is properly registered
- Create or update `.storybook/preview.ts` to apply a11y parameters globally to all stories
- Configure the addon to enforce WCAG AA standards

### 3. Add documentation for a11y testing
- Update one of the component stories to serve as an example of proper a11y documentation
- Consider adding a dedicated a11y documentation page

### 4. Run a11y tests on all stories
- Run Storybook
- Use the a11y panel to identify and fix any violations
- Pay special attention to:
  - Color contrast
  - Keyboard navigation
  - Screen reader accessibility
  - Proper ARIA attributes
  - Semantic HTML

### 5. Fix any identified issues
- Make necessary adjustments to components that don't pass the tests
- Document any patterns or common fixes needed

## Success Criteria
- A11y tests run automatically on all stories
- No violations are reported for WCAG AA standards
- Documentation exists on how to use and maintain a11y compliance
