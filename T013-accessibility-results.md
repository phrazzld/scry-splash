## Keyboard Navigation

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Tab Order | ✅ Pass | Tab sequence is logical: Input field → CTA button → Theme switch |
| Focus Visibility | ⚠️ Needs Improvement | Focus indicators are minimal and could be more visible |
| Interactive Elements | ✅ Pass | All interactive elements are keyboard accessible |

## Screen Reader Compatibility

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Semantic HTML | ✅ Pass | Proper use of headings, buttons, and form elements |
| ARIA Attributes | ⚠️ Missing | Theme toggle buttons could benefit from aria-label attributes |
| Text Alternatives | ✅ Pass | No critical images without alt text |

## Responsive Design

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Zoom Compatibility | ✅ Pass | Content remains accessible up to 200% zoom |
| Mobile Rendering | ✅ Pass | Layout adapts well to mobile viewport sizes |
| Touch Targets | ✅ Pass | Buttons and interactive elements have sufficient size |

## Issues and Recommendations

### Critical Issues
1. **Dark Theme Placeholder Contrast**: The placeholder text in dark mode has insufficient contrast (4.17:1). Recommendation: Increase opacity to at least 0.75 or lighten the color.

### Improvements Needed
1. **Focus States**: Enhance focus visibility by adding a more prominent focus outline or ring to interactive elements.
2. **ARIA Attributes**: Add aria-labels to theme toggle buttons (e.g., "Switch to light theme", "Switch to dark theme", "Use system theme preference").
3. **Muted Text in Light Mode**: The contrast ratio (4.56:1) just barely passes AA. Consider darkening slightly for better accessibility.

## Conclusion
The theme implementation is generally accessible with excellent contrast for primary content in both themes. A few minor improvements would enhance accessibility, particularly for users with visual impairments or those who rely on screen readers.

## Next Steps
1. Fix the dark mode placeholder contrast issue
2. Improve focus states for better keyboard navigation
3. Add appropriate ARIA labels to theme toggle buttons
